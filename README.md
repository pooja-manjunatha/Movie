From Box Office Bombs to Blockbuster Hits: An Analytical Look at the Movie Industry
Movies have been a significant part of our lives for more than a century, and they have always been an integral part of the entertainment industry. In recent years, with the growth of the internet and streaming services, movies have become more accessible than ever before. This has also led to a growing interest in analyzing and understanding the movie industry.
In this blog, we will be exploring the IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, which contains information on over 5,000 movies released between 1916 and 2016. We will be using Neo4j, a graph database to perform various analyses and visualizations on this dataset.
Our focus will be on identifying the top 10 highest-grossing movies, analyzing movie profits, ratings, and other key factors that contribute to a movie's success. Through this analysis, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the movie industry and the factors that contribute to a movie's success.
I love watching movies and hence the analysis. Hope you enjoy it!
